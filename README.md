# zsh-theme

After spending some time using the pwnbox on a HackTheBox machine, I really enjoyed its terminal setup. However, I couldn't find any easy sources to make my Kali Linux terminal look similar. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and customize my terminal to create a personalized and stylish experience that I love.
